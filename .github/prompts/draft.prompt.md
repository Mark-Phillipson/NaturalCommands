 Look into the possibility of creating a feature where I can say something like natural show letters and a user interface would draw unique two letter combinations an all clickable items in the current user interface on the current screen

to allow for quick navigation and selection using voice commands.

 The user should then be able to use the talon alphabet to pick a particular label that would in turn trigger a click event on the corresponding UI element.

 May need to use the accessibility API to enumerate the UI elements on the screen and their bounding rectangles to accurately overlay the labels.

Would need to work on both browsers and window desktop applications.

Please plan this out and if possible provide an implementation.
