I would like to add the ability to create a mode that, when activated, would automatically left click the mouse if it is held still for half a second. However, this countdown would reset if the mouse is moved.

This feature would enhance the experience of playing games by voice, allowing users to enjoy music while playing without the need to click the mouse at the right time. For example, this would be beneficial when playing a card game.

It would be advantageous to have a user interface to indicate when the mode is set, along with a countdown timer to show when the click will occur. The interface should be non-intrusive and disappear when the mouse is moved again.

 We should be able to have a default of half a second but have a setting to adjust this when required.
