# New Mouse Move Voice Commands

I would like to add functionality so that I can move the mouse by voice. I want to say "move down," "left," "right," or "up," and the mouse would start moving in that direction. I would then like to be able to say "stop mouse" for it to stop moving and also "stop click" to perform a left click action.

Additionally, I would like to say "faster" or "slower" to increase or decrease the speed of the mouse movement.

Currently, Talon does not support these commands. Are they possible in this project?

I would prefer it to work in all applications using Windows 11 and not just in Windows Forms applications.
